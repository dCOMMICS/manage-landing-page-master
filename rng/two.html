    <p>I started writing not very long ago, and I have been loving it so far. The fact that I can put down stuff I write in words is really amazing. <span class='line'>I get to learn double</span>, and I also get to help others when they read my articles.
    </p>

<p>Not very sure if you should start writing or not? You could get started with <strong class="hashnode">Hashnode </strong>. The experience is surreal!</p>
